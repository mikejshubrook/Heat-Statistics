The code in the notebook 'heatstatisticscode_final' can be used to reproduce the results from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08829 'Non-Markovian Quantum Heat Statistics with the Reaction Coordinate Mapping'. (exclusing Figure 4 which was calculated using Mathematica.

The accompanying functions file 'heat_stats_sz_functions' contains all of the functions required.
